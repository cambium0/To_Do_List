# To_Do_List
Python To-Do List web app made with Flask.
Another Flask app from the group of three on Amazon AWS. They all have the same URL except for the end, nothing, 'flask_2', or 'flask_3'
I wish I could remember the name of the middleware that routes the request to the proper flask app, but I can't recall right now.
